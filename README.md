# yt-channel-videos-to-queue

1) Open a YouTube video
2) Click the bookmark to load the user's uploads playlist
3) Open console by using F12
4) Paste the script
5) Ready!

I don't think a public or auto-generated playlist of all uploads exists, only recent uploads, which is the same as what you see when you click play in the corner of a user's playlist called uploads, and the same you'll find by using this bookmarklet
